<br>
a Python Project to control THORLABS CLD1015 through Web Brower.

## Introduction

This Flask project runs on a local computer that connects the CLD1015 through USB as a server. Any LAN devices can send command to the CLD1015 through web brower.

You can turn on/off the LD and change the current setpoint easily.

> **Note**
> Once the command is sent, the CLD1015 will be in the remote control state, and the remote icon on the panel will be lit.

> **Warning**
> Once the CLD1015 is in the remote control state, the local operation will be prohibited unless the local button on the panel is touched.
